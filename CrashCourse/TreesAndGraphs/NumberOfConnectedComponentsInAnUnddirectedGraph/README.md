[323\. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/description/)

You have a graph of `n` nodes. You are given an integer `n` and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return _the number of connected components in the graph_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = \[\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[3,4\]\]
**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = \[\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[2,3\],\[3,4\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 2000`
-   `1 <= edges.length <= 5000`
-   `edges[i].length == 2`
-   `0 <= ai <= bi < n`
-   `ai != bi`
-   There are no repeated edges.
